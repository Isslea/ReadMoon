# ReadMoon
This Application was created to connect readers, I was inspired by webpage GoodReads (or polish version LubimyCzytaÄ‡). You can clone code and simply run it via IDE, or it is possible to use docker
<br><br><br>
To run this app via Docker you need to open your terminal and choose place where you want your ReadMoonrepository and type those commands one by one:
  1. ```git clone https://github.com/Isslea/ReadMoon.git```
  2. ```cd ReadMoon/ReadMoon```
  3. ```docker compose up```

Now you can go to ```localhost:5005/Book``` and do whatever you want :)
